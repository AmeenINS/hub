### üß© Project Description

We need to build a **comprehensive User Management and Access Control System**, along with a **Task Management module** integrated into the same platform. The system must follow **modern security standards**, **clean architecture principles**, and be implemented using the **latest stable frameworks and libraries**.

---

### üë§ User Management & Dynamic Access Control

The system should include a **robust and fully dynamic role-based access control (RBAC)** mechanism:

1. **Admin User (Root)**

   * At initialization, there will be only one **super admin** with full access to all system resources.
   * The super admin can manage all users, roles, and permissions.

2. **Dynamic Role Creation**

   * The admin must be able to **create new roles dynamically**, e.g. ‚ÄúManager,‚Äù ‚ÄúTeam Lead,‚Äù ‚ÄúEmployee,‚Äù etc.
   * Each role can have customized access levels assigned to it (CRUD permissions per module or action).

3. **Permission Assignment**

   * The system should allow **fine-grained control**, meaning permissions can be assigned at the module, action, or even record level.
   * Example: a Manager can create and assign tasks, while an Employee can only view and update the status of their own tasks.

4. **User-Role Relationship**

   * Each user is assigned one or more roles.
   * Access rights for the user are automatically determined based on the assigned role(s).
   * Multiple users may share the same role and inherit identical permissions.

5. **Authentication & Security**

   * Use **secure authentication mechanisms** (JWT, OAuth2, or session-based tokens).
   * Passwords must be hashed (Argon2 or bcrypt).
   * Implement 2FA support for admin accounts.
   * Full audit logging for user actions.

### ‚úÖ Task Management System

A complete internal **task assignment and tracking system** must be integrated.

1. **Task Creation and Assignment**

   * Each department manager can assign tasks to employees.
   * Tasks can have priority, due date, status (To-Do, In-Progress, Done), and attached notes or files.

2. **Employee Dashboard**

   * Each employee should have a personalized dashboard displaying their assigned tasks for the day or week.
   * They can **update task status**, **add progress notes**, and **attach documents**.

3. **Manager Dashboard**

   * Managers can **monitor the progress** of their employees‚Äô tasks in real time.
   * Include visual indicators for completion percentage and overdue tasks.

4. **Notifications**

   * Implement smart notifications for new tasks, deadlines, and task updates (email, in-app, or both).

5. **Task History & Reports**

   * Full activity logs for all tasks, including changes in status and comments.
   * Exportable task reports per employee, department, or time range.

---

### üóÑÔ∏è Database

* Database engine: **LMDB** ([https://dbdb.io/db/lmdb](https://dbdb.io/db/lmdb))
* Use LMDB for its **lightweight, high-performance, and secure** design.
* Ensure data consistency, encryption at rest, and efficient indexing.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Architecture Standards

* Follow **OWASP best practices** for application security.
* Use **modern encryption and token validation** for all sensitive operations.
* The application must be **modular, scalable, and maintainable** using clean code architecture (e.g., layered or hexagonal).
* Implement **role-based middleware** for API endpoints to ensure secure access.
* Logging and error handling should be centralized and configurable.
